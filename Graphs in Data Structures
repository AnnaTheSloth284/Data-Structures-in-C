# Graphs-in-Data-Structures
**All you need to know about graphs to get started**

The _graph_ is a non linear data structure that consists of finite sets of vertices(nodes) and a bunch of edges connecting with them.

        graph = vertices + edges

Graph **G** is a pair of sets**(V,E)** where **V** is the vertices and **E** sets of edges connecting with the pair of vertices.

# Graph Terminologies
•**_Adjacent Vertices_:** If there is an edge between two vertices.

•**_Adjacent Edges_:** If there is a common vertex between two edges.

•**_Degree_:** In undirected graph, the number of vertices to the vertes is known as degree.

•**_Path_:** The path is a sequence of distinct vertices such that two consecutive vertices are adjacent.

•**_Cycle_:** A path that has only one repeated vertices are the first and last vertices.

•**_Walk_:** A walk in the sequence of vertices and edges of the graph used to traverse from one vertex to another.

# Types of Graph
•**_Finite graph_:** where the no. of vertices and edges are finite in number.

•**_Infinite graph_:** the number of vertices and number of edges is infinite.

•**_Trivial graph_:** The graph is said to be trivial if there is only a single vertex without any edges.

•**_Simple graph_:** A graph is said to be simple if there is only one and one edge between each vertex.

•**_Multi graph_:** If there are multiple edges between a pair of vertices in the graph, it is a multi graph.

•**_Null graph_:** The graph is said to be a null graph if there are only vertices exits, not edges.

•**_Complete graph_:** The graph is a complete graph where each vertex must be connected with other vertices using the edges.

•**_Pseudo graph_:** A graph which contains a self-loop and other edges.

**_Directed graph_:** where each edge has a direction associated with it.

**_Regular graph_:** where each vertex of the graph has the same degree.

•**_Weighted graph_:** where each edge holds some weight that denotes traversal cost through edges.

•**_Connected graph_:** where each pair/group of vertices in the graph is connected.

•**_Disconnected graph_:** where each pair/group of vertices in the graph is not connected.

•**_Cyclic graph_:** if it contains atleast one cycle in a graph.

•**_Acyclic graph_:** if it contains no cycle at all.

# Graph Representation
There are generally two ways to represent the graph structure:

**1. Adjacency Matrix:** is a sequential representation used to represent nodes that are adjacent to each other. _If there is an edge between two vertices_, the value of the corresponding element of the graph is _1, otherwise 0_. In the case of weighted graphs, if there is an edge present, rather than showing whether there is or not a node between two vertices in the form of 1(=true) or 0(=false), we can store the weight of the edge to show that an edge exists.

Eg: Consider two vertices A and B such that they are connected by an edge whose weight is 5. Then, we can use the weight of that edge, that is 5, to show that there exists an edge in between A and B.

**2. Adjacency List:** is a linked representation maintaining the list of its neighbours for each vertex in the graph. Every vertex of the graph contains the list of its adjacency vertices. Array of vertices whichhave vertices, indexed by each vertex number and for every vertex, the array element points to a linked list of neighbours of a vertex.

# Graph Traversal
Refers to the process of examining each edge and vertex once in a graph. Can be performed in 2 ways:

_1. Breadth-First Search(BFS) Algorithm_: BFS starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the neighbouring nodes. Then, the nearest node is selected and all the new nodes are explored. The queue data structure is used in BFS.

_2. Depth First Search(DFS) Algorithm_: DFS starts traversing the graph from the initial node of the graph, and then it goes deeper and deeper until it finds the node has no child. Then, pointer is backtracked from the dead end towards the adjacent unexplored nodes. The stack data structure is used in DFS.
