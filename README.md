# Linked Lists

Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
1. Does nt require continuous memory

Traversing thru a linked list: Pass a reference into linked list, that is a head node

Suppose you set A as a current node to go to the nxt node set current.next=<the next node>
  If .next link points to NULL=> link list fully traversed
